**Sri Ramakrishna** said:

> What is the message of the Gita? It is what happens when you repeat it ten times.
> If ‘Gita’ is repeated ten times, it sounds like ‘tagi’ — tyagi — one who renounces.
> This is the teaching of the Gita: ‘O man, try to realize God by giving up everything.’

I didn't get it for many years, until one day I realized, all four yogas are different forms of renunciation.

- **Jnana Yoga** — Renounce the reality of the world. Realize the Self alone is true.
- **Bhakti Yoga** — Renounce personal will. Surrender completely to God’s will.
- **Raja Yoga** — Renounce thoughts. Still the mind in deep silence.
- **Karma Yoga** — Renounce the result of action. Offer all actions without expectation.

The Bhagavad Gita shows many paths, but the essence is one: _Renunciation_.
