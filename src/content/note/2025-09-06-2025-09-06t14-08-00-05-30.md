Finally started my journey my learn ML/DL from ground up.


Completed [Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science](https://coursera.org/share/4ba5d65a3df9d87e99e10296a3030624) on Coursera.


There is a lot more to Linear Algebra, so I am continuing with [3Blue1Brown's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/) in parallel while I start the Calculus course.
